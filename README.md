# Bulk-Book-Web-Application
built a simple application with asp.net 6 and SSMS.
I used entity framework core to setup my database connection string and any related database operation.
Once that's configured, I will then use CRUD operation with any model. The project has its client side and server
side validations that it has to go through. I also added a feature to make alerts using TempData and toastrjs.
